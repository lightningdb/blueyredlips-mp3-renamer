every gui i've used to rename my mp3s to match tags has been rubbish (apart from EasyTag, but i couldn't get it to run on os x).

so i spent five minutes (okay, more like thirty five) creating this script, with a sane naming convention and rudimentary specs

sudo port install id3lib
sudo gem install id3lib-ruby

then:
ruby rename_mp3s.rb
options:
-v    will print out the files as they are renamed

renames to ths convention:
Track Number - Artist - Album - Title
and neatens up if any of these are not available.

please hack the hell out of this. (ha, i just typed 'please hack the hello out of this' -- do that too please)
